# docuTV - Makes your reading nights with the screen no longer suck.

The on-screen document reading deserves to be more convenient!

When reading documents:

* Jumping around among a series of fractions in a page should be automatic, and -

* The screen space should be made full use of, 

* Just inside the browser, with only keyboard, no mouses or touching devices needed.

Usage:

* Open docuTV.html inside browser and learn how to use, or

* View How-To-Use.org for the Detail.
